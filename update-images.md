# Google Drive Image Setup

The folder ID is: 1cqmsJNKOLZZ3rbTxqLet-tKIxi42bl79

To use Google Drive images, we need the individual file IDs for each image.

## For now, I'll use a proxy service to load Google Drive images:

Format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`

Please provide the file IDs for:
1. Miami_Yachting_Company_60_Azimut_Bravo58 (hero image)
2. Any other yacht photos you want to use

You can get the file ID by:
1. Right-click the image in Google Drive
2. Click "Get link"
3. The ID is the long string in the URL after `/d/` or `id=`

Example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123XYZ/view
The ID is: 1ABC123XYZ
