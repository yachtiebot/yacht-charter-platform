Keep them but add "Photo Coming Soon" badge or similar indicator.

## Current Status:
**7 out of 11 flowers have correct photos (64% accurate)**

The sub-agent that built the galleries assigned whatever images were available, but didn't have photos for 4 arrangements, so it reused others. This creates customer confusion.
