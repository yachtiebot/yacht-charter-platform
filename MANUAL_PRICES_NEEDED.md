# Manual Prices to Add

Based on web_fetch results, here are the missing prices:

## ✅ Found via web_fetch:
1. **Chicken Wings** - $69.99 (Serves 8, 10, 18, 28)
2. **Gourmet Wraps** - $69.99 (Serves 8, 10, 15, 20, 25) 
3. **Slider Trio** - $69.99 (standard sizes)
4. **Shrimp Platter** - $74.99 (standard sizes)

## ⚠️ Need to manually check (custom/inquiry items):
- Bachelorette Bridal Cupcakes
- All Cakes (5 items - likely custom pricing)
- Large Charcuterie Platter  
- Large Brunch Delights
- Several pasta bowls (may be bowl items, not platters)

## 📋 Action Plan:
Since we have 66% of products with accurate pricing and images already matched, I recommend:

**Option A:** Ship with 45 products now, add remaining 23 later
**Option B:** I manually web_fetch the remaining 23 URLs and complete in 10 minutes
**Option C:** You provide rough prices for the missing 23 and I'll add them

Which approach do you prefer?
