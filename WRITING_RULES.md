# Writing Rules & Style Guide

## ❌ BANNED WORDS & PHRASES

**Never use these overused/cliché terms:**
- Elevate / Elevated
- Pinnacle
- Epitome
- New level / Next level
- Take it to the next level
- **Balloons** (illegal on boats in Miami marinas - never mention or show in yacht/boat context)

These words are corporate clichés that undermine authentic luxury messaging. Balloons are banned for legal/environmental reasons.

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

Instead of "elevate your experience":
- Enhance your experience
- Refine your journey
- Perfect your charter
- Transform your time onboard

Instead of "pinnacle of luxury":
- Finest luxury
- Exceptional luxury
- Pure luxury
- Uncompromising luxury

Instead of "epitome of elegance":
- Definition of elegance
- True elegance
- Refined elegance
- Timeless elegance

Instead of "take it to the next level":
- Exceed expectations
- Go beyond
- Surpass the ordinary
- Set a new standard

## Writing Style

### Tone
- **Confident, not boastful**
- **Specific, not vague**
- **Elegant, not flowery**
- **Authentic, not corporate**

### Best Practices
- Show, don't tell
- Use concrete details over abstract claims
- Let quality speak for itself
- Avoid superlatives unless backed by specifics
- Write like a luxury magazine, not a sales brochure

### Examples

❌ **Bad:** "Elevate your yacht charter to the pinnacle of luxury"
✅ **Good:** "Exceptional additions for those who appreciate the finer details"

❌ **Bad:** "Experience the epitome of Miami yachting"
✅ **Good:** "A curated fleet of privately owned vessels, hand selected for comfort and style"

❌ **Bad:** "Take your celebration to the next level"
✅ **Good:** "Transform your celebration into an unforgettable moment"

## Voice

**Miami Yachting Company speaks as:**
- A trusted curator, not a salesperson
- A knowledgeable insider, not a showoff
- A refined host, not a hype man
- A confident expert, not a corporate drone

**We sound like:** Vogue meets Ocean Drive - editorial, sophisticated, understated luxury.

**We don't sound like:** Generic luxury marketing copy, corporate brochures, or sales pitches.
