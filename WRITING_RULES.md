# Writing Rules & Style Guide

## ❌ BANNED WORDS & PHRASES

**Never use these overused/cliché terms:**
- Elevate / Elevated
- Pinnacle
- Epitome
- New level / Next level
- Take it to the next level
- **Balloons** (illegal on boats in Miami marinas - never mention or show in yacht/boat context)

These words are corporate clichés that undermine authentic luxury messaging. Balloons are banned for legal/environmental reasons.

## ❌ NO DASHES OR HYPHENS IN PUBLIC-FACING TEXT

**Rule:** Never use dashes (-) or hyphens in any customer-facing content.

**Instead:**

1. **For compound words:** Remove the dash completely
   - ❌ "Add-Ons" → ✅ "Add Ons"
   - ❌ "First-Class" → ✅ "First Class"
   - ❌ "Full-Service" → ✅ "Full Service"
   - ❌ "On-Board" → ✅ "Onboard"

2. **For sentence punctuation:** Use commas instead
   - ❌ "We offer catering - including fresh seafood - for your charter"
   - ✅ "We offer catering, including fresh seafood, for your charter"
   
   - ❌ "Perfect for celebrations - birthdays, anniversaries, proposals"
   - ✅ "Perfect for celebrations, birthdays, anniversaries, proposals"

3. **For lists or breaks:** Use commas or restructure
   - ❌ "Luxury yachts - professionally maintained - available daily"
   - ✅ "Luxury yachts, professionally maintained, available daily"

**Note:** This applies to all text users see (headings, body copy, buttons, navigation). Technical code/URLs/filenames can still use dashes.

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

Instead of "elevate your experience":
- Enhance your experience
- Refine your journey
- Perfect your charter
- Transform your time onboard

Instead of "pinnacle of luxury":
- Finest luxury
- Exceptional luxury
- Pure luxury
- Uncompromising luxury

Instead of "epitome of elegance":
- Definition of elegance
- True elegance
- Refined elegance
- Timeless elegance

Instead of "take it to the next level":
- Exceed expectations
- Go beyond
- Surpass the ordinary
- Set a new standard

## Writing Style

### Tone
- **Confident, not boastful**
- **Specific, not vague**
- **Elegant, not flowery**
- **Authentic, not corporate**

### Best Practices
- Show, don't tell
- Use concrete details over abstract claims
- Let quality speak for itself
- Avoid superlatives unless backed by specifics
- Write like a luxury magazine, not a sales brochure

### Examples

❌ **Bad:** "Elevate your yacht charter to the pinnacle of luxury"
✅ **Good:** "Exceptional additions for those who appreciate the finer details"

❌ **Bad:** "Experience the epitome of Miami yachting"
✅ **Good:** "A curated fleet of privately owned vessels, hand selected for comfort and style"

❌ **Bad:** "Take your celebration to the next level"
✅ **Good:** "Transform your celebration into an unforgettable moment"

## Voice

**Miami Yachting Company speaks as:**
- A trusted curator, not a salesperson
- A knowledgeable insider, not a showoff
- A refined host, not a hype man
- A confident expert, not a corporate drone

**We sound like:** Vogue meets Ocean Drive - editorial, sophisticated, understated luxury.

**We don't sound like:** Generic luxury marketing copy, corporate brochures, or sales pitches.

## 🚨 LEGAL & COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Bareboat Charter Compliance (USCG & FWC)

**NEVER mention or imply:**
- ❌ Crew is included
- ❌ Captain is provided
- ❌ Staff comes with the yacht
- ❌ "Crewed charter"
- ❌ "Fully staffed"
- ❌ Any services included in the charter

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Describe only the vessel itself
- ✅ Use manufacturer specifications
- ✅ Describe features and amenities of the boat
- ✅ Be vague about what comes with the charter
- ✅ Let customers inquire for details

**Safe Language:**
- "This vessel features..."
- "The yacht is equipped with..."
- "Manufacturer specifications include..."
- "Available for charter in Miami"
- "Contact us to customize your experience"

### Use Case Restrictions

**NEVER assume or suggest use cases unless explicitly marked in Airtable:**

❌ **Don't say:** "Perfect for corporate events, birthdays, and weddings"
✅ **Do say:** "Contact us to discuss your charter needs" (if no use cases marked)

**Only mention specific use cases if that checkbox is TRUE in Airtable:**
- Corporate Events (checkbox)
- Birthday Celebrations (checkbox)
- Bachelorette Parties (checkbox)
- Proposals (checkbox)
- Anniversaries (checkbox)
- Family Outings (checkbox)

**If checkbox is checked, you may say:**
- "Ideal for corporate events"
- "Popular choice for birthday celebrations"

**Source Material:**
1. Manufacturer description (if available)

3. Marketable language (compliant)

**Short Description (Fleet Listing - 1-2 sentences):**
- Focus: Key specs + one standout feature
- Length: 120-180 characters
- SEO: Include yacht type, location, capacity

**Example:**

**Long Description (Detail Page - 2-4 paragraphs):**
- Para 1: Manufacturer specs + vessel features
- Para 2: Onboard amenities and layout

- Para 4 (optional): Use cases IF selected in Airtable
- Length: 250-400 words MAX (SEO best practice)

### Product Descriptions (Catering, Flowers, Water Toys)

**Auto-Generated Based on Category:**

**Catering - Short (2-3 sentences):**
- What it is + serves how many + one quality note

**Example:**
"Made fresh to order with premium ingredients. Serves 8 to 25 guests depending on platter size. A popular choice for yacht charters and celebrations."

- Arrangement style + flowers included + occasion note

**Example:**

**Water Toys - Short (2-3 sentences):**
- What it is + key feature + usage note + lead time if applicable

**Example:**
"Luxury underwater jet ski allowing riders to glide on the surface or dive below. Batteries last 1 to 2 hours. Requires 48 hours advance notice."
